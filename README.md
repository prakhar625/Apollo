###### 21<sup>st</sup> Century Web Music Player

This repo is supposed to serve as a repository for a music player that serves the need of power users. Who has access to multiple streaming services, and want a single place to handle all their music needs.

My target is to create an application that supports:<br />
<br />
A. streaming music from any streaming service's url
  - [ ] Youtube
  - [ ] Spotify
  - [ ] Soundcloud
  - [ ] Apple Music
  - [ ] Google Play Music
  - [ ] offline media

B. Get URL's from the clipboard <br />
C. Get URL's from the sharing menu. Be available in the shaing menu.<br />
D. After getting the URL, shows the user the available streaming services that the song is available on.<br />
E. Also help users create (publicly / privately) sharable streaming service agnostic music playlists, which can be opened by anyone, anywhere and something that can be customised too.<br />
F. Once the user selects the streaming service, validate credentials and let them play the music in the web-player (most preferrd option)<br />
